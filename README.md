# grip-strength-estimation


This project uses a nodemcu (ESP8266) and flex sensors to assess grip strength. Grip strength is a crucial indicator of the health and functionality of the hands and can be used to identify problems like arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome.

In this study, we detect the amount of bend in the fingers when they grasp an object using flex sensors, and we utilise a mathematical model to translate that information into an estimate of grip strength. The sensor data is processed by the nodemcu and quantized signal is processed in MATLAB

The microcotroller's source code, hardware assembly instructions, and a schematic are all included in this repository.
